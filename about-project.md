### What it does
In this project, I got stock return data and treasury bond interest rate from two separate APIs, then transformed the data into a usable form, then made a streamlit dashboard to display when the data falls under a certain condition. On the dashboard, you can select different stocks and sectors. I also created two visualizations of the price and volume data for the individual stocks and sectors that are displayed on the streamlit dashboard. You can select which stock you want to display, and select how many day you want for the moving average.

### How you run my project
Run the analysis.py file with the streamlit runner

### Other things you need to know

I am double majoring in Economics, and one thing we talked about in a macroeconomics class I took this past semester is the link between the interest rate of U.S. treasury securities and the prices of U.S. stocks.

 Normally, both have an inverse relationship -- if stock prices fall, treasury security interest rates rise, and vice-versa. 
 
 However, if stock prices fall and the interest rates of treasury securities does not rise, then that could mean that investors do not view U.S. treasury bonds as a safe haven for their money anymore, or investors are anticipating persistent inflation. 
 
 We have seen this recently with the economic chaos that has come with the Trump Administration's tarriff policy.

 With this project, I wanted to highlight months when there has been increased uncertainity around the United State's Treasury Bond's status as a highly safe asset.
